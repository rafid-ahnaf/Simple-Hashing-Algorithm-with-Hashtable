This Python script implements a straightforward hashing algorithm using a hashtable. The algorithm takes a list of elements as input and calculates a hash function for each element, considering the number of consonants and the sum of digits in the element. In cases of hash collisions, the script utilizes linear probing to find an available slot in the hashtable. The resulting hashtable provides an organized storage space for the input elements, demonstrating a basic approach to handling hash functions and collisions.
